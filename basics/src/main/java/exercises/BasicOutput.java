        In this exercise we are going to do two simple outputs. On two separate lines I would like
        you to print on the first line "Hello World", but by using print statements instead of println and on the second I want you to print
        "Hello, my name is <name>!" where you replace <name> with whatever name you want. However,
        you can not fill in <name> inside the string, instead you need to use concatenation to solve this
        problem. Hint: use a variable.
