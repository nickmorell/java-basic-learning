    /*
        For this exercise I want you to create two methods. One that will take in two String objects
        and compare them, return true or false. The second method will take in two numbers, compare
        them and return true or false. As an added bonus I have provided 3 separate int arrays for you.
        Create a third method that compares not if they are the same object but if they contain the same
        numbers and the same number of said numbers.
        For example an array with {1, 4} and {1, 4, 4} have the same numbers. But one contains only
        one 4 while the other has multiple. In this case we return false.

        int[] arr3 = {23, 2, 9, 83, 63, 25, 86};
