        Going against the better judgement of everyone around me I am deciding to build a house.
        The only issue is im terrible at math but that's where you come in. I constantly have issues
        finding the area and perimeter when doing my work. Help me out and setup two methods, one for
        perimeter, area and if you really want to help me out make a method for volume as well. Remember
        though measurements are never whole numbers so pick the right variable type. The methods should
        return the same variable type and then you should print out the answer on a new line.
