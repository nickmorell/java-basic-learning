        Like the real world you wont have all the answers shown to you, and this is the start
        of you're first challenge. I never showed you how to work with string methods or how
        to really manipulate them, so we will here but don't worry I will give some guidance.
        Im going to want three methods from you:

        1. Write a method that takes in a String and then returns the reverse of the String you
        passed in. To do this you will want to somehow get the String into a char array and then
        iterate through it with a loop.

        2. Write a method that takes in a String with the syntax [A-z} - {A-z], like Teterboro Airport - KTEB,
        and then swap the two sides around -, so we would get KTEB - Teterboro Airport. This will use the split
        method on a String.

        3. Write a method that takes in TWO String parameters. The first will be a Query string and the
        second will be a String that you will be searching for inside the Query string. The String being
        searched for has to be an exact match BUT case does not matter. If it does return true, otherwise
        return false and print the result.
        Ex: Searching for "QU" in "query" should produce the result true.

    public static void main(String[] args){
        String airport = "Teterboro International Airport - KTEB";
    }
